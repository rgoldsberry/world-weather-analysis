Data Analysis Bootcamp - Week 6
The purpose of this repo is to collect my work done in learning APIs with Python. 

## Lesson Work

Deliverables we created throughout the lessons are detailed below and the code used to generate them can be found in [WeatherPy.ipynb](WeatherPy.ipynb) and [VacationPy.ipynb](VacationPy.ipynb)
 - Create scatter plots of the weather data for the following comparisons:
   - Latitude vs temperature
   - Latitude vs humidity
   - Latitude vs cloudiness
   - Latitude vs wind speed
 - Determine the correlations for the following weather data:
   - Latitude and temperature
   - Latitude and humidity
   - Latitude and cloudiness
   - Latitude and wind speed
 - Create a series of heatmaps using the Google Maps and Places API that showcases the following:
   - Latitude and temperature
   - Latitude and humidity
   - Latitude and cloudiness
   - Latitude and wind speed
- Create a heatmap with pop-up markers that can display information on specific cities based on a customer's travel preferences

## Challenge Work

We were tasked with creating three deliverables in this challenge:
1. Retrieving weather data for a new random set of cities generated from 2,000 latlong pairs. Final csv output is saved in [WeatherPy_Database.csv](Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv)
2. Creating a travel destinations map from user input of minimum and maximum preferred temperatures. An image of the map with marker layers is saved in [WeatherPy_vacation_map.png](Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation_map.png)
3. Creating a travel itinerary map from a country where four cities were chosen with temperatures in the desired range. We're headed to Mauritius and the route map is saved in [WeatherPy_travel_map.png](Vacation_Itinerary/WeatherPy_travel_map.png) and a map with the markers map saved in [WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png](Vacation_Itinerary/WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png)
